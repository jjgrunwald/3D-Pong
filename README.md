# 3D-Pong
by J.J. Grunwald

Developed an innovative 3D Pong game for my final project in Programming Fundamentals II, demonstrating advanced skills in C# and 3D graphic programming. Initially inspired by isometric graphics, I envisioned a pong game with a pseudo-3D appearance. Encouraged by my instructor, I expanded the project's scope to create a fully immersive 3D experience, moving beyond mere isometric illusions.

Key Features:

      Engineered using C#, leveraging primitive graphics and custom-designed art assets including the game title, iconography, and keyboard layout guides.
      Implemented a bespoke 'Vector' class for precise 3D coordinate management (X, Y, and Z axes), facilitating realistic object movements and interactions within the game environment.
      Utilized a sophisticated 3x3 Perspective Matrix, constructed from nine distinct matrices, to render a dynamic 3D perspective, enhancing gameplay realism and depth.
      Architectured the game with robust object-oriented principles, dividing game elements into distinct classes for the paddle, ball, score, and a 'Referee' class to oversee game rules and mechanics.
      This project not only underscored my programming proficiency and ability to transform conceptual designs into functional gaming software but also reflected my capacity for creative problem-solving and adherence to object-oriented programming standards.
